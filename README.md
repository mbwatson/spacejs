## About

This is a template for a spaceship game that can be played on various, user-chosen two-manifolds, including a torus, projective plan, and Klein Bottle.

The direction this will go has not been decided upon.
I just wanted to get the basics done so it's ready to go when the time comes. This is the typical type of game I write as I learn a new language or new library, which&mdash;right now&mdash; is p5.js. Writing this kind of game opens the door to the nuances of all the most-used features. In addition, it'sjust good fun.
